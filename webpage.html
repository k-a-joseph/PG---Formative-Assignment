                        <dd>Instead of purchasing new clothes, consider buying from second-hand and charity shops. This a good way to get something 
                            new while having minimal negative on the planet. This is also a way to give back to the community as most thrift stores
                            are associated with a charity, who recieve a percentage of their profit. Additionally, you can get high-quality clothing in good  
                            condition for a fraction of what you would pay if you were buying it brand new.

                            Will you actually use this piece? How much use would you get out of this piece? These are all important
                            questions to ask yourself before you buy something new.

                            Advice: Wait at least two weeks before buying something new. If you still want/need it after two weeks,
                            then buy it.
